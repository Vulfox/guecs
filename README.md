Goal of this repo is to come out of this with further understanding of what it takes to form a GUI lib using an ECS framework.

TODO:
- Render a label using gkurve?
- Render a widget
  - A 0,0 GUI coord at top left
  - An ECS Input Event System
  - A resizable Rect
  - A clickable Rect
  - A moveable Rect
  - A Button
- Pass events as ECS for widgets to trigger
